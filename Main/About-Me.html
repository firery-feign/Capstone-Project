        <h2>About Me</h2>

        I recently moved from a small town in BC called Grand Forks, to Mission BC. I have always had an interest in programming and how it works and always had the idea that one day I could be a successful dev.<br>
        With this Capstone project I plan to showcase what skills I have learned in a short amount of time to demonstrate my ability to learn and adapt to new situations.<br>
